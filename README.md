# Deep-Analytics-on-Power-Consumption-Data-Set-using-R

Data consists of residential electrical power usage data from 2007 to 2010. In this project we are using the data drom the data base. We will be assuming that we have given access to a database containing 47 months of power usage data. The comapany claims to have not been occupying a specific residence at the time of an undisclosed event during the Summer of 2008. Our job will be to analyze this data to determine what kind of analytics and visualizations can be created to prove or diapprove of this claim.

In general our objectives are the below:

    Analyze the given data set and determine missing data & outliers 
    
    Find the hidden patterns
    
    Verify if during any time period, there is a pattern mismatch
    
    Determine if the pattern holds true during Summer of 2008
